# Wi-Fi Controlled RGB Scrap Metal Tree

A multi-color RGB LED Tree made from scrap copper and silver. The colors and patterns can be controlled from a web browser over Wi-Fi.

!

## Features
- Built entirely from scrap materials.
- 16 individually addressable RGB LEDs.
- Wi-Fi control via a simple web interface.
- Multiple color patterns and brightness control.

## Hardware Required
- ESP32 or ESP8266 microcontroller
- WS2812B LED strip (or similar)
- 5V Power Supply
- Copper and silver wire for the tree structure
- ... (add other components)

## How to Build
1.  **Assemble the Tree:** Describe how you built the physical tree from the scrap metal.
2.  **Wiring:** CONNECT THE DATA IN PIN OF RGB STRIP TO PIN NO16 ON ESP32 .
3.  **Software:** IN MY CASE I CHOESE WLED .

## Code
The code in the `/src` folder runs on the ESP32. You will need the following libraries in your Arduino IDE:
WLED (WLED INSTALL) THEN HIT INSTALL WITH SUPPOTED SETTING
